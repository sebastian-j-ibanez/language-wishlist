# 🗒️ language-wishlist
This is an attempt to list the attributes of the perfect programming language. This list is based entirely on my opinions.

## Design
- Compiled
- Statically typed
- Opt in garbage collection
- Immutable variables by default
- Multi-paradigm (OOP, functional, procedural)
- Comparable performance to modern C++ and safe Rust

## Features
- First party build tools included
- Defer (like Go or Zig)

## Syntax
- No semicolons
- Pattern matching
- Guard cases
