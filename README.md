# üóíÔ∏è language-wishlist
This is an attempt to list the attributes of the perfect programming language. This list is based entirely on my opinions.

For context, my languages of choice are C and C++. I have tried C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, Go, and Haskell for various school and side projects.

## Design
- Compiled
- Statically typed
- Opt in garbage collection
- Immutable variables by default
- Multi-paradigm (OOP, functional, procedural)
- Comparable performance to modern C++ and safe Rust

## Features
- First party build tools included
- Defer (like Go or Zig)

## Syntax
- Whitespace sensitive (Haskell ‚ù§Ô∏è)
- No semicolons
- Pattern matching
- Guard cases
- Simple type names (i64, u8, etc. should be burned)
